- **Jueyuan Liu** â€“ MSc Student,Econometrics in TU Dortmund
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project develops and evaluates **probabilistic day-ahead electricity price forecasts** for the German market.  
The study employs three core modeling approaches:
- **ARX** (Autoregressive with Exogenous Variables)  
- **MARX** (Multi-hour Adaptive Regression with Exogenous Variables)  
- **QRA** (Quantile Regression Averaging)  

The goal is to move beyond point forecasts by providing **quantile-based probabilistic forecasts**, enabling robust risk management and decision-making in highly volatile electricity markets.

## âš¡ Motivation
Electricity price forecasting is essential for:  
- Market participants â†’ bidding strategies & hedging  
- System operators â†’ grid balancing & reserve planning  
- Policymakers â†’ market design & renewable integration  

Germanyâ€™s day-ahead market, with its high share of renewables, requires **probabilistic approaches** to better quantify **uncertainty**.

## ðŸ›  Methodology
- **Data source**: ENTSO-E Transparency Platform (2017â€“2025)  
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Time format standardization & CET/CEST alignment  
  - Gap filling via interpolation & forward/backward fill  
  - Outlier detection with **hour-specific MAD** & Winsorization  
  - Calendar feature engineering (holidays, weekends, seasonality)  
- **Models**:
  - ARX â†’ captures temporal dependencies with lagged exogenous inputs  
  - MARX â†’ fits 24 hourly models to capture intra-day heterogeneity  
  - QRA â†’ ensembles ARX & MARX predictions into full predictive distributions  
- **Rolling window setup**:  
  - Training: 2019â€“2021  
  - Validation: 2022  
  - Test: 2023â€“2025  
  - 180-day rolling windows, 7-day forecasting horizon

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation
- **Point forecast metrics**: MSE, MAE, RÂ²  
- **Probabilistic metrics**: Pinball Loss, CRPS, Interval Coverage, Calibration  
- **Key findings**:
  - ARX fits training data well but overfits in validation/test  
  - MARX generalizes better across changing conditions  
  - QRA provides calibrated quantile forecasts but tends to under-estimate uncertainty in mid-quantiles
